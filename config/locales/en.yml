            <div class="accordion-body">\n
              By default, the last used shipping address will be saved into to your Sample Store account. When you are
              checking out your order, the default shipping address will be displayed and you have the option to amend it if
              you need to.

            <div class="accordion-body">\n
              The instructions to activate your account will be sent to your email once you have submitted the registration
              form. If you did not receive this email, your email service providerâ€™s mailing software may be blocking it.

              Because you are important to us, we want to know what you think about the products. As an added value, every
              time you rate the products you earn points which go straight to your account. 1 point are added to your
              account for every review that you give. You will need those points in order to redeem the sample products. So
